# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open, inclusive, and welcoming environment for research and collaboration in AI for Materials and Molecules, we pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Project-Specific Guidelines

## Working Together

To promote efficient and harmonious collaboration:

* Work as openly as possible while respecting privacy choices and agency
* Follow the 50/50 rule: for each issue raised, try to propose a solution

* Avoid jargon and ask for clarification when needed
* Provide timely feedback when requested
* Use version control best practices and maintain clear documentation
* Respect project workflow and coding standards

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/) and the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.0.

To make a report:

1. Document the incident with as much detail as possible
2. Contact the project maintainers through the designated reporting channels
3. Wait for acknowledgment of your report
4. Cooperate with any follow-up requests for information

The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances.
