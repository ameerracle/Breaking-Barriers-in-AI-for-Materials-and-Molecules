# **AI for Materials and Molecules**  

## 👋 **Welcome!**  

Hello and welcome to the **AI for Materials and Molecules** project! This initiative aims to bridge the gap between **artificial intelligence (AI)** and **materials science**, empowering researchers with tools, knowledge, and resources to drive innovation in material discovery.  

Whether you're an **AI enthusiast**, a **materials scientist**, or simply **curious** about this exciting intersection, you're in the right place!

## 📝 **Project Overview**  

The **AI for Materials and Molecules** project focuses on developing **tools, tutorials, and documentation** to make AI and machine learning accessible for materials research. In Canada, expertise in this field is concentrated in hub cities like **Montreal** and **Toronto**, leaving many researchers without adequate mentorship or resources.  

Our project addresses this knowledge gap by:  

- 📚 **Hosting educational webinars** on practical AI/ML applications for materials research.  
- 🎥 **Creating open-access resources**, including video tutorials and GitHub documentation.  
- 🌐 **Establishing online communities** to foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing.  
- 🗳️ **Conducting surveys and focus groups** to understand and address unique challenges faced by underrepresented groups in this field.  

We believe that by **democratizing access to AI tools and knowledge**, we can **accelerate discoveries** in materials science and **create a more inclusive research ecosystem**.
