AI for Materials and Molecules

👋 Welcome!
Hello and welcome to the AI for Materials and Molecules project! This initiative aims to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and materials science, empowering researchers with tools, knowledge, and resources to drive innovation in material discovery. Whether you're an AI enthusiast, a materials scientist, or someone simply curious about this exciting intersection, you're in the right place!

📝 Project Overview
The AI for Materials and Molecules project focuses on developing tools, tutorials, and documentation to make AI and machine learning accessible for materials research. In Canada, expertise in this field is concentrated in hub cities like Montreal and Toronto, leaving many researchers without adequate mentorship or resources.
Our project addresses this knowledge gap by:
  •	Hosting educational webinars on practical AI/ML applications for materials research.
  •	Creating open-access resources, including video tutorials and GitHub documentation.
  •	Establishing online communities to foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing.
  •	Conducting surveys and focus groups to understand and address unique challenges faced by underrepresented groups in this field.
We believe that by democratizing access to AI tools and knowledge, we can accelerate discoveries in materials science and create a more inclusive research ecosystem.

🚀 What Makes This Project Special?
  •	Practical Education: Step-by-step tutorials and webinars tailored to real-world materials research challenges.
  •	Montreal-Based: The founders and collborators are based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada
  •	Open Access: All resources, including webinars and documentation, are freely available.
  •	Community-Driven: Building an active online network of researchers to exchange ideas and collaborate.
